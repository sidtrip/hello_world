I'm a deep thinker interested in the complexities of working of this world, love to learn; though a slow learner, 
once I am adept at a skill I tend to perform them with utmost precision and with acquired depth of knowledge.

I have interest in and pursue Map Dynamics(Topographic), Photography, Outdoor Activities especially Cycling, 
Running, and Mountaineering with jest. I hope these and many other unmentioned aspects of my life somehow add to my 
personality which might leave some helping influence to us all as we come in touch with each other.
