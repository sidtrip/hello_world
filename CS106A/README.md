Code in Place [https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/course]

Due midnight April 8th, 2020 Anywhere on Earth

The time of COVID-19 has been difficult for many people around the world, in many different ways. As an act of community 
service, a group of computer science instructors is coming together to offer our teaching services free of charge for people 
who want to learn introductory coding.

For beginners: We donâ€™t expect you to have any coding knowledge before taking this course! We expect the exercises to be a 
little tricky - but you can do it - check out the FAQs if you get stuck!

Code in place has run out of space! We were expecting hundreds, maybe as many as a thousand students. But people had a great 
time programming Karel, told their friends and we had an astounding 80,000 people started an application. This is a community 
service project that we are doing on top of our day jobs. As such we could only support a small fraction of how many we would 
have liked. If you haven't received an email, we didn't have space, and the email might have bounced. Thank you for your time 
to complete the application. We wish you the best on your coding journey.

Eventually ~10000 people ended up being enrolled and we had 900 section leaders.
Course Spanned from 13 April 2020 to 27 April 2020
